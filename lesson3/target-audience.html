      <h1>Target Audience</h1>
      <p>
        The audience of for this site will be business people who are looking to
        align themselves with a supportive and active group. This is for
        businesses who want a group that hosts events for charities and to raise
        awareness of the small businesses in our community.
      </p>
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <h3>First</h3>
      <p>
        The first group of people will be small businesses. Generally they will
        be family owned and operated with some outside help. Their business will
        not be known to most of the population in the area so they will need to
        be recognized. Joining this chamber will help them with that.
      </p>
      <h3>Second</h3>
      <p>
        The second group of people will be franchises and bigger, more stable
        businesses. They will be looking to align themselves with a group where
        they will be able to receive support as well as be the support to the
        chamber
